## Welcome to the 4Culture Heritage Mapping Project

## Project Purpose

Rooted in the 4Culture Heritage Department’s mission, this project aims to support, advocate for, and preserve the broad and inclusive heritage of King County. It recognizes that heritage includes not only material collections, but also the exchange of knowledge and lived experiences shaped by the past.

By mapping organizations and individuals engaged in heritage work, the project affirms the importance of both institutional and community-based approaches to cultural preservation. It reflects the stories, practices, and traditions of communities that have long resided in this region, as well as those who have migrated here over time.
