# Objects Directory

This folder contains the media assets associated with the 4Culture Heritage Mapping Project.

Each file in this directory corresponds to an organization, archive, or collection featured in our metadata. These may include logos, photographs, scans, or media samples from heritage initiatives across King County.

The CollectionBuilder-GH template is optimized for small digital collections and public-facing prototypes. All items in this folder are manually added and referenced via the `filename` field in your metadata CSV.

## Guidelines for Use

To ensure smooth functionality and web accessibility, please follow these best practices when managing files in this directory:

- **File Size**: Keep files web-friendly. For example, JPEG images should be under 1MB and ideally no wider than 1200px. PDFs should be compressed and audio/video files minimized.
- **Total Size**: GitHub recommends repositories stay under 1GB. Limit this folder to ~500MB for optimal performance.
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase filenames with no spaces or special characters. Use underscores (`_`) instead. Filenames must exactly match the `filename` column in your metadata file.

### Example:
If your metadata includes:
```csv
filename
scarecrow_archive.jpg
